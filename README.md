# **discord.js-ModerationBot** 
ModerationBot V1 is a simple moderation bot with all basics commands that a bot needs!! This is the First version of this bot and the bot gets updated with new version every month!! So make sure to follow me on GitHub for latest updates!! 
#**Setup** 
Import the project into repl.it and then fill out your bot token in config.js file.. Then type npm install in the console and let repl.it install all the packages.. Next after everything is complete run the bot and the bot will come online!! And if you dont know how to make it 24/7 watch the video on my channel :)
